          <td>Anna Karenina tells of the doomed love affair 
            between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the 
            dashing officer, Count Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds 
            as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and must endure 
            the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and 
            richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, 
            the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic 
            imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and 
            country life and all the variations on love 
            and family happiness.</td>

            <td>Gustave Flaubert</td>
            <td>For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate 
                its contents with profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary 
                was tried for "offenses against morality and religion." What shocks 
                us today about Flaubert's devastatingly realized tale of a young 
                woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is 
                its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure, the opulence 
                of its prose (marvelously captured in the English translation of 
                Francis Steegmuller), and its creation of a world whose minor 
                figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.</td>

                leading up to Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and the impact of 
                the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, as seen through the eyes 
                of five Russian aristocratic families.</td>
