        <h1>The Well-Rounded Programmer</h1>
        <p>At the end of the day, programming languages are just sets of specific rules that allow us to instruct computers to perform tasks. </p>
        <p>But while a programmer can always focus their study on mastering one language, those that broaden their horizons by learning a range of languages are usually better prepared for careers in software engineering (and related fields).</p>
        <p>That said, no programmer will ever be able to master every programming language that’s out there. That’s why it’s important to be familiar with your options. </p> 
        <p>If you know what languages perform best in what circumstances and you know what kinds of problems you’ll be working to solve, then choosing the right coding language (or languages) becomes much simpler.</p>
        <p>After all, the tech world is growing. And for those who want to secure a place in it, growing their repertoire of programming languages can be a rewarding move. Just remember, starting somewhere is better than not starting at all.</p>
